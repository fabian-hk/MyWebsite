OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are playing an important role in modern applications. OIDC is used for authentication whereas OAuth is used to grant access to protected resources. Therefore, it is important to correctly implement and harden those techniques against malicious actors.

This presentation gives a short introduction to OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 and describes the most important flows. After that, common attacks and their mitigations are shown and in the end, there is a summary and an outlook on new developments in the OAuth community. The main source for this presentation is the [OAuth 2.0 Security BCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16).
