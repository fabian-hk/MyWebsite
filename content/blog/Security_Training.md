Nowadays, 60 percent of the world's population has access to the internet<sup>1)</sup>. Users spend on average three hours a day online<sup>2)</sup> with shopping, browsing social media, or doing bank transactions.

While using online services, it is always important to keep your data and accounts secure. If you do not pay attention to what you are doing online, you can easily be attacked by hackers as the attack on the iCloud of Jennifer Lawrence a few years ago showed<sup>3)</sup>.

Therefore it is important for users to learn how to spot malicious websites on the internet and how to secure accounts. In the following, you can find the presentation of a workshop I conducted for the [Jugendpresse BW](https://jpbw.de/). The workshop is designed for people who want to build up a basic knowledge in cybersecurity. It covers the following topics:
- Generating and storing secure passwords
- Using 2-factor-authentication
- Identifying phishing websites and emails
- Securely surfing the web via HTTPS
- Securing devices (e.g. Smartphones, Laptops, ...) and personal data
