Nowadays, 60 percent of the world's population has access to the internet<sup>1)</sup>. Users spend on average three hours a day online<sup>2)</sup> browsing social media, shopping, or doing bank transactions.

While using online services, it is always important to keep your data and accounts secure. If you do not pay attention to what you are doing online, you can easily be attacked by hackers as the attack on the iCloud of Jennifer Lawrence a few years ago showed.

Therefore it is important for users to learn how to spot malicious sites on the internet and to learn how to secure accounts. In the following, you can see my slides from the workshop I conducted for the [Jugendpresse BW](https://jpbw.de/). The workshop is designed for people who do not know anything about cybersecurity. It covers the following topics:
- Generating and storing secure passwords
- Using 2-factor-authentication
- Identify phishing sites and emails
- Securely surfing the web with HTTPS
- Securing devices and data
